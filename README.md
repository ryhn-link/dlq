### Won't add
- Append - D already lets you append arrays using `~=`
- AsEnumerable - This project only uses arrays
- Contains - D lets you do that using the `x in y`
- ElementAt - `[n]` gets the element at n-th position
- Empty - `[ ]` creates an empty array
- Reverse - `array` already has a property with the same name that does the same thing 
- SelectMany - Just run Select multiple times
- SequenceEqual - `[] == []` does the same thing
- Single - What's the point? Just check the length and use `first`
- ThenBy - D doesn't have deferred execution
- ThenByDescending - same as `ThenBy`
- ToArray - Same as `AsEnumerable`
- ToHashSet - Same as `AsEnumerable`
- ToList - Same as `AsEnumerable`
- ToLookup - Same as `AsEnumerable`
